'''
You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list always contains a tail and a loop. Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

For example in the following picture the tail's size is 3 and the loop size is 12:

'''

def loop_size(node):
    turtle, rabbit = node.next, node.next.next
    
    # Find a point in the loop.  Any point will do!
    # Since the rabbit moves faster than the turtle
    # and the kata guarantees a loop, the rabbit will
    # eventually catch up with the turtle.
    while turtle != rabbit:
        turtle = turtle.next
        rabbit = rabbit.next.next
  
    # The turtle and rabbit are now on the same node,
    # but we know that node is in a loop.  So now we
    # keep the turtle motionless and move the rabbit
    # until it finds the turtle again, counting the
    # nodes the rabbit visits in the mean time.
    count = 1
    rabbit = rabbit.next
    while turtle != rabbit:
        count += 1
        rabbit = rabbit.next

    # voila
    return count
